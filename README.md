OpenERP-Talend-Component
========================

Input and Output Component for Talend Open Studio (Dataintegration)

Recently we were looking for Talend OpenERP components but soon discovered that there aren't any.

As a result we developed two new community components:

tOpenERPInput for reading objects
tOpenERPOutput for object creation, updates and object deletion
tOpenERPInput

Further information and an instruction about the use of the properties of the components can be found at our blog:

Thanks to the creators of the OpenERP Java API which we used as core library to communicate with OpenERP
